# Stack-Overflow-Data---2017-Survey findings.

This is my findings for the project 1 'Write a Data Science Blog Post' for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program.

Python Code is attached.

I am new to data science and python. Any advice is welcomed here.

I want to complete this program successully and will be able to hop on some interesting analysis on my own.

I want to thank Udactiy Data Science Program where I learn everything from scratch. 

Here is my findings:

There are 51,392 participants in this 2017 survey. Among them, arround 70% participants are identified as 'Professional developer' and around 48% participants like to program as a hobby. Most participants (more than 20%) are from United States and Indians came as second. There are more than 40% participants own Bachelor's degree. More than 20% took online coures. Accoding to my analysis, only 2169 out of 51,392 participants attended Bootcamp, which accounts for around 4%. 86% of those who graduated from the Bootcamp are male. 49% Bootcamp attendees admit they already own the job while starting the program. Independent contractors, who works at smaller company or who is able to work remotely, who likes to program and contributes to open source projects have higher job satisfaction. There is a positive relation between Salary, Job Satisfaction, Career Satisifaction and Stack Overflow Satisifaction, HoursPerWeek. Accoring to my training data and predictor model where salary is prediced based on Job Satisfaction, Career Satisifaction and Stack Overflow Satisifaction, HoursPerWeek, there is about 4% of the variance in salary can be preidcted by previous salary: The r-squared score for the model using only quantitative variables was 0.04072431792894726 on 3868 values.
